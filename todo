ToDos:
    Ldap-authentication:
        ☐ Create a simple LDAP-connection
        ☐ Get users from said LDAP-connection
        ☐ Get specific user and compare password
            See https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ldap-compare.php for example (Found out that this maybe not be the best solution)
            Recommended way are to ldap_bind($dn, $userCN, $password)
            Returns True at sucess, False at failure
            You can retrive errorcodes by using ldap_get_option($ds, LDAP_OPT_ERROR_STRING, $error)
        ☐ Create an authentication provider in Laravel
